### Markdown2Docx

This is an early stage gem that will allow you to create a template (currently used for release documents), and then apply some yaml that has variables defined containing markdown, or straight text.

Each variable corresponds to the text $/variable$.

To use:

  sudo gem install markdown2docx
  md2docx template.docx data.yaml output.docx

To use it within ruby code:

  require 'releaseDocMarkdown'
  w = ReleaseDocMarkdown.open('templates/release.docx')
  w.merge\_yaml('release.yaml')
  w.save('release.docx')

To install, from source, you'll need to create the gem file:

gem build markdown2docx.gemspec
gem install markdown2docx

Look in samples to see a sample yaml file.
